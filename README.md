# EKitchenStory

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.8.

This is a work in part of Simplilearn's and Saudi Digital Academy Course: .NET Fullstack Developer Track.


# Important Notes:
- Make sure that you have MongoDB & NodeJS installed.
- The NodeJS Server will automatically create two users if not already exist. The first one is an admin user; the other is a customer user. You can simply register for a customer user if you want to.

- The admin user credentials are:
     - Email: admin@kitchenstory.com
     - Password: ```admin1234```
- The customer user credentials are:
     - Email: customer@kitchenstory.com
     - Password: ```123456```

# How to Run
- Run ‘npm install’ in the project’s root directory.
- Navigate in your terminal to ‘server’ directory using: ‘cd server’.
- Run ‘npm run server’.
     - At this point the server will create the users if this is your first run.
-	Navigate back in your terminal to the root directory.
- Run ‘ng serve’.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
